## Nepali
This is a `golang` implementation of the package from [opensource-nepal](https://github.com/opensource-nepal)'s `python` package [nepali](https://github.com/opensource-nepal/py-nepali).

We'll try to include all the features provided in the aforementioned package. We'll be releasing features in parts to support all or most features given by `go`'s `time` package.

### Installing

To install this package use `go get`

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/opensource-nepal/nepali
```

Or if there is some error then, use `go install`

```shell
$ go install github.com/opensource-nepal/nepali
```

#### Usage

_NOTE: Currently this package is in beta version, so it only includes basic features like date conversion and parsing. Also, the output is read-only._

In this package, we provide 2 `go` packages, `nepalitime` and `dateConverter`.

1. `nepalitime`: The functionalities provided in `nepalitime` are described below:

   1. To get a Nepali datetime object:

      ```go
      import "github.com/opensource-nepal/nepali/nepalitime"

      npTime, err := nepalitime.Date(2079,  10,  15,  14,  29,  6,  7)
      ```

      The `err` object could containing error if you pass in errornous values into the `Date` function.
      
      Once you have the `NepaliTime` object, you will be able to access methods, some of which are described below:
      1. `GetEnglishTime()` -> Returns the corresponding English time
      2. `Date()` -> Returns year, month and day as separate return values
      3. `Clock()` -> Returns hour, minute and second as separate return values

   2. If you already have a `time.Time` object then, you can get the corresponding `NepaliTime` object using the function `FromEnglishTime`:

      ```go
      import "github.com/opensource-nepal/nepali/nepalitime"

      // just to ensure that the timezone is Asia/Kathmandu
      // else the time will be adjusted accordingly
      enTime := time.Date(2023, 1, 29, 14, 29, 6, 7, nepalitime.GetNepaliLocation())
      nt, err := nepalitime.FromEnglishTime(enTime)
      ```

   3. To parse a datestring into a `NepaliTime` object the `Parse` function can be used. This is the Nepali equivalent of the `time.Parse` function of go but instead of using the time parsing format of `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006` we decided to go with the `%Y/%m/%d` style parsing. We intend on supporting the go style formatting in the upcoming releases. Please see [directives](#date-directives) section to know which directives we support.

      ```go
      import "github.com/opensource-nepal/nepali/nepalitime"

      datetimeStr := "2079/10/14"
      format := "%Y/%m/%d"

      npTime, err := nepalitime.Parse(datetimeStr, format)
      ```

   4. To get current Nepali time:

      ```go
      import "github.com/opensource-nepal/nepali/nepalitime"

      npTime := nepalitime.Now()
      ```

   5. To get the current English time in Nepal:

      ```go
      import "github.com/opensource-nepal/nepali/nepalitime"

      enTime := nepalitime.GetCurrentEnglishTime()
      ```

2. `dateConverter`: The functionalities provided in `dateConverter` are described below:

   1. This is one of the core functionalities in which an English date(not an object) is converted to Nepali date in parts i.e. year, month, day in an array:

      ```go
      import "github.com/opensource-nepal/nepali/nepalitime"

      // npDate is an array of 3 length which contains
      // year, month and day sequential form
      npDate, err := dateConverter.EnglishToNepali(2023, 1, 28)
      ```

   2. To convert a Nepali date(not an object) to English date in parts i.e. year, month, day in an array:

      ```go
      import "github.com/opensource-nepal/nepali/nepalitime"

      // enDate is an array of 3 length which contains
      // year, month and day sequential form
      enDate, err := dateConverter.NepaliToEnglish(2087, 8, 10)
      ```
